# Todo List Created using JavaScript

A minimalistic, mobile friendly/responsive 'to do list' webapp created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

**Functionalities:**

1. Add a task by pressing enter or clicking add
2. Aesthetically pleasing check and cross animation when task complete button clicked.
3. 'Clear' button to delete all tasks.
4. Local storage to store tasks in user's computer. Can be cleared by clearing cache.

**To test it out:**

1. Download the codebase .zip file.
2. Right click index.html, open with Google Chrome or your favorite browser.
3. I'll also add this project to [my website](https://hasaniqbal.com) when it is finished.
